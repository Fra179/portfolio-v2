Mensapp V2 is an **unofficial** alternative to Disco Lazio's MensaApp, an application that allows students in Lazio to enter canteens in the region. One of the biggest features this app has to offer is the possibility to share your own QR Code with other users that may not be accredited to enter the canteen. 

This app lacks some features that the official app has, like the ability to set a PIN or to use biometric authentication to access the app. This app was made for a restricted number of users who deemed the features unnecessary.

As of now, it's only possible to share the "secret" used to generate the QR Code with other users, but I'm planning to add a feature that allows users to share access to the QR Code only up until a certain time, after which the access will be revoked.

Please note that this app is __not affiliated__ with Disco Lazio in any way.
