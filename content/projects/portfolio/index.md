Every developer needs a portfolio, right? This is mine! And it's actually the second version, the first one was made using a template I found on the internet and was too heavy for my taste. For this version I decided to do the design myself, and then use [Hugo]() to generate the website starting from the Markdown pages (I really didn't feel like writing every page in HTML by hand). 
HUGO already lists a few templates that you can use to generate your website on [this page](), but for every portfolio template I found I either didn't like the design or it was missing some features I wanted. So I decided to do it myself, taking some inspiration from [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder)
