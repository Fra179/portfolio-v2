[Sapienza Flight Team](https://www.sasa-aerospace.it/flight-team/) is a student association that designs and builds self-flying UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to compete in the annual [SUAS](https://suas-competition.org/) competition. The team is composed of students from different faculties, including Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Electronics Engineering. 

At Sapienza Flight Team, I'm part of the Computer Vision team, where I'm responsible for developing the software that performs offline and real time Object Detection, Classification and Geolocalization. The challenges we face are many and very interesting, from the development of the software to the integration with the hardware, to the testing and debugging of a system that can't fail.

As of now, I'm in charge of a team tasked with developing a fast and accurate Object Detection system that can run on a Jetson Nano board.
