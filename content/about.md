Hello everyone, I'm a 21 year old developer from Italy. Currently enrolled in a BSc in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University of Rome. Since a very young age I've been interested in technology and computers in general. I'm proficient in Python and Go, I've also used C, C++, CUDA, Java and Dart (for Flutter) in the past for personal and university projects. I love the challenge of learning a new language and I'm always up for it. I'm also interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, that's my main area of study as of now. If you're interested in my work please have a look at my [Projects](/projects/)

I'm also a big fan of self-hosting my own services. I'm currently running and managing multiple services including, but not limited to, Nextcloud, Adguard Home, Bitwarden, and many more. I'm also responsible for hosting and servicing an open source alternative to Notion called [Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline/) to share student notes in my faculty.
